# Day - 02 (Programming Language Fundamentals)

### Software
Software is a collection of programs designed to perform specific tasks.
-   There are 2 types of software

    -   System software (Operating System)
    -   Application software

-   We need system software to run the Application software.

### Programming Language

-   There are three types of programming language
    -   Low Level Programming Language - used to create system software
        -   (binary is used)
        -   Assembly
    -   Middle Level Programming Language
        -   used to create both
        -   c, c++
    -   High Level Programming Language - used to create application
        -   software (human language is used, english)
        -   java, Go, Javascript etc.

### Javascript language:

-   Javascript is a client side programming language.
-   Client Side
    -   runs on browser
    -   eg javascript, VBScript.
-   Server Side language

    -   runs on servers
    -   NodeJS, PHP, Python etc.

-   To make mobile application we use ionic, React Native etc.
-   To make desktop application we use Electron.js.

-   Community support of Javascript is very rich.

-   In programming language single line of code is called a i**nstruction/statement**.

-   Interpreter covert javascript code into machine code.
-   **Interpreter** execute code line by line.
-   **Compiler** execute all code at once.

-   V8 engine has compiler and interpretor both. Compiler is used to execute very complex task and to optimize code.
-   V8 engine decides to use compiler or interpreter.
