# Day - 04 (Variable & Keywords in JavaScript)

- In programming languages we store data in RAM using variables.

- Variables are used to store data in the RAM.

- To declare variable we use `var` keyword in JS.
    ```js
        var x = 10;
        // here 10 is not stored in x, x stores the memory address where 10 is present.
    ```
- Always use descriptive variable names like (age, height, etc. not x, y, z).
